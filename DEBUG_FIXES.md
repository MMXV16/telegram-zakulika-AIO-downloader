# Debug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Torrent File Path Error
**Problem**: Error `ValueError: Failed to convert /tmp/downloads/6286176953/Game.of.Thrones.S08E06.WEB.H264-MEMENTO[rarbg] to media. Not an existing file`

**Solution**: 
- Added file existence verification before sending files to Telegram in `torrent_handler.py`
- Enhanced error logging to identify when files go missing
- Added proper path validation in `utils/telegram_helpers.py`

### 2. YouTube/Instagram Download Failures
**Problem**: Videos failing to download due to authentication and yt-dlp configuration issues

**Solutions**:
- Updated YouTube extractor args to include 'tv' client for better success rate
- Added alternative innertube hosts for YouTube
- Updated Instagram user agent to newer iOS version
- Added more specific extractor arguments for Instagram compatibility
- Enhanced error handling with more descriptive error messages
- Added handling for HTTP 403, 429, and other common errors

### 3. Instagram Authentication and Rate Limiting Issues ⭐ **NEW FIX**
**Problem**: Instagram downloads failing with "login required" and "rate-limit reached" errors

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Enhanced Instagram Configuration**: Updated to use iOS 18.1 user agent and modern headers
- **Improved Extractor Arguments**: 
  - Enabled newer API version (v2) with fallback support
  - Added proper HLS handling and format compatibility
  - Included better retry mechanisms and sleep intervals
- **Fallback Extraction System**: Added two-tier extraction approach
  - Primary method with full configuration
  - Fallback method with minimal options if primary fails
- **Better Error Categorization**: Enhanced error detection for:
  - Authentication errors (401, login required)
  - Rate limiting (429, too many requests)
  - Content availability (403, private, deleted)
  - Network issues (timeouts, connection errors)
- **Cookie Integration**: Improved user-specific cookie handling for Instagram

### 4. Tasks Getting Stuck in Queue ⭐ **NEW FIX**
**Problem**: Video and playlist tasks entering queue status but never progressing

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Fixed Queue Management**: Ensured `task_done()` is called exactly once for every dequeued task
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added proper task completion in all exception paths
- **Enhanced Finally Blocks**: Guaranteed task cleanup regardless of success or failure
- **Better Status Tracking**: Improved task status transitions to prevent stuck states

### 5. Compression Not Working for Large Files
**Problem**: Compression failing for torrents >2GB and returning empty results

**Solutions**:
- Fixed input validation in `utils/compressor.py` to check for valid files
- Added better error handling and propagation in compression functions
- Fixed return value handling in `stream_compress` function
- Enhanced error messages for debugging compression issues
- Added file existence checks before compression

### 6. Excessive Message Deletion
**Problem**: System deleting all messages including important ones like progress updates

**Solutions**:
- Made message deletion more conservative in `delete_tracked_messages`
- Added message content checking to preserve important messages (quality selection, status updates)
- Only delete actual progress messages, keep important status messages
- Improved message tracking to distinguish between temporary and important messages
- Added proper error handling for message deletion failures

## Technical Improvements

### Video Downloader Enhancements
- Better YouTube client fallback strategy
- Improved Instagram compatibility with newer API versions and fallback system
- Enhanced error messages for common failure scenarios
- Better handling of rate limiting and access restrictions
- Two-tier extraction system for improved reliability

### Task Queue Management
- **Guaranteed Task Completion**: Every dequeued task now properly calls `task_done()`
- **Improved Error Paths**: All exception scenarios properly handle task completion
- **Better Resource Cleanup**: Enhanced finally blocks ensure proper cleanup
- **Status Consistency**: Improved task status tracking to prevent inconsistencies

### Instagram-Specific Improvements
- **Modern Headers**: Updated to iOS 18.1 user agent for better compatibility
- **API Fallback**: Primary extraction with v2 API, fallback to basic extraction
- **Enhanced Retry Logic**: Better retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Cookie Integration**: Improved user cookie handling for authenticated requests
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Better detection and handling of Instagram rate limits

### Compression System Fixes
- Robust file validation before compression
- Better error propagation and reporting
- Enhanced progress tracking and user feedback
- Improved cleanup of temporary files

### Message Management
- Smart message deletion that preserves important information
- Better tracking of message types (progress vs status)
- Improved error handling for message operations
- Enhanced logging for debugging message issues

### Error Handling
- More descriptive error messages for user feedback
- Better error categorization (authentication, rate limiting, etc.)
- Improved logging for debugging purposes
- Graceful handling of network and API failures
