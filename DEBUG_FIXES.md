### 7. Compression Not Working for Large Files
### 1. Torrent File Path Error
**Problem**: Error `ValueError: Failed to convert /tmp/downloads/6286176953/Game.of.Thrones.S08E06.WEB.H264-MEMENTO[rarbg] to media. Not an existing file`

**Solution**: 
- Added file existence verification before sending files to Telegram in `torrent_handler.py`
- Enhanced error logging to identify when files go missing
- Added proper path validation in `utils/telegram_helpers.py`

### 2. YouTube/Instagram Download Failures
**Problem**: Videos failing to download due to authentication and yt-dlp configuration issues

**Solutions**:

- Added alternative innertube hosts for YouTube
- Updated Instagram user agent to newer iOS version
- Added more specific extractor arguments for Instagram compatibility
- Enhanced error handling with more descriptive error messages
- Added handling for HTTP 403, 429, and other common errors

### 3. Instagram Authentication and Rate Limiting Issues ⭐ **NEW FIX**

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Enhanced Instagram Configuration**: Updated to use iOS 18.1 user agent and modern headers
- **Improved Extractor Arguments**: 
  - Enabled newer API version (v2) with fallback support
  - Added proper HLS handling and format compatibility
  - Included better retry mechanisms and sleep intervals
- **Fallback Extraction System**: Added two-tier extraction approach
  - Primary method with full configuration
  - Fallback method with minimal options if primary fails
- **Better Error Categorization**: Enhanced error detection for:
  - Authentication errors (401, login required)
  - Rate limiting (429, too many requests)
  - Content availability (403, private, deleted)
  - Network issues (timeouts, connection errors)
- **Cookie Integration**: Improved user-specific cookie handling for Instagram

### 4. YouTube Bot Detection and Authentication Issues ⭐ **NEW FIX**
**Problem**: YouTube videos failing with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" and authentication errors

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Improved YouTube Configuration**: 
  - Use only 'web' client instead of multiple clients to avoid bot detection
  - Enhanced HTTP headers with proper browser simulation
  - Added sleep intervals to avoid rate limiting
  - Disabled comment extraction and problematic format types
- **Enhanced Error Detection**: Added specific handling for:
  - Bot detection ("Sign in to confirm you're not a bot")
  - Authentication errors (401 Unauthorized)
  - Rate limiting (429 Too Many Requests)
  - Access forbidden (403 Forbidden)
- **Better Cookie Integration**: Improved user cookie handling for authenticated requests
- **Simplified Extractor Configuration**: Reduced complexity to avoid triggering additional security measures

### 5. Tasks Getting Stuck in Queue ⭐ **CRITICAL FIX**
**Problem**: Video and playlist tasks entering queue status but never progressing

**Root Cause**: The video queue handler was not calling `task_done()` when tasks transitioned to `AWAITING_USER_INPUT` status

**Solutions Applied**:
- **Fixed Queue Management**: Ensured `task_done()` is called when queue processing completes, even if task waits for user input
- **Proper Task Flow**: Queue processing now properly completes when presenting options to user
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added proper task completion in all exception paths
- **Enhanced Finally Blocks**: Guaranteed task cleanup regardless of success or failure
- **Better Status Tracking**: Improved task status transitions to prevent stuck states

### 6. Instagram Authentication and Rate Limiting Issues ⭐ **ENHANCED FIX**
**Problem**: Compression failing for torrents >2GB and returning empty results

**Solutions**:
- Fixed input validation in `utils/compressor.py` to check for valid files
- Added better error handling and propagation in compression functions
- Fixed return value handling in `stream_compress` function
- Enhanced error messages for debugging compression issues
- Added file existence checks before compression

### 6. Excessive Message Deletion
**Problem**: System deleting all messages including important ones like progress updates

**Solutions**:
- Made message deletion more conservative in `delete_tracked_messages`
- Added message content checking to preserve important messages (quality selection, status updates)
- Only delete actual progress messages, keep important status messages
- Improved message tracking to distinguish between temporary and important messages
- Added proper error handling for message deletion failures

## Technical Improvements

### Video Downloader Enhancements
- **YouTube Bot Detection Avoidance**: Simplified client configuration to use only 'web' client
