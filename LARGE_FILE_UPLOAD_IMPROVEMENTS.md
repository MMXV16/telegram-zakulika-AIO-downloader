# Large File Upload Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to handle large file uploads (particularly 29GB+ files) that were causing bot crashes. The improvements focus on memory management, connection stability, and robust error handling.

## Key Problems Addressed

### 1. Memory Management Issues
- **Problem**: Large files (29GB+) were exhausting system memory during compression and upload
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented aggressive garbage collection between parts
  - Added real-time memory monitoring during uploads
  - Reduced memory thresholds (75% instead of 80%)
  - Enhanced cleanup procedures

### 2. Upload Timeouts
- **Problem**: Fixed timeouts were insufficient for very large files
- **Solution**:
  - Dynamic timeout calculation based on file size
  - Base timeout of 10 minutes + 1 minute per 100MB
  - Maximum timeout of 1 hour per part
  - Separate handling for massive files (>10GB)

### 3. Connection Stability
- **Problem**: Network interruptions during long uploads caused crashes
- **Solution**:
  - Increased retry count from 3 to 5 attempts
  - Exponential backoff with longer waits for large files
  - Better error handling for NetworkError and ConnectionError
  - Flood wait handling that doesn't count as failed attempts

### 4. File Splitting Optimization
- **Problem**: Large files weren't split optimally, creating oversized parts
- **Solution**:
  - Adaptive part sizes based on total file size:
    - >100GB files: 1.5GB parts
    - >50GB files: 1.6GB parts
    - >20GB files: 1.7GB parts
    - >10GB files: 1.8GB parts
  - Massive file handler for files >10GB
  - Smart compression with better memory management

## New Components

### 1. Enhanced Upload Handler (`improved_upload.py`)
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic timeout calculation
  - Real-time memory monitoring
  - Aggressive memory cleanup
  - Enhanced progress tracking
  - Better error messages

### 2. Smart Upload System (`smart_upload.py`)
- **Features**:
  - Intelligent method selection based on file size
  - Upload time estimation
  - Optimal part size calculation
  - Automatic detection of problematic files

### 3. Massive File Handler
- **Features**:
  - Specialized handling for files >10GB
  - File splitting before upload
  - Memory-conscious processing
  - Enhanced stability for very large datasets

### 4. Upload Manager (`upload_manager.py`)
- **Features**:
  - Unified interface for all upload types
  - Automatic fallback mechanisms
  - Compatibility with existing code
  - Enhanced error recovery

## Configuration Changes

### Memory Management
- `MAX_MEMORY_USAGE`: Reduced from 80% to 75%
- `CRITICAL_MEMORY_THRESHOLD`: Set to 85%
- Added `MASSIVE_FILE_THRESHOLD`: 10GB

### Timeouts
- `LARGE_FILE_TIMEOUT`: Increased from 10 to 30 minutes
- `UPLOAD_RETRY_DELAY`: Increased from 30 to 60 seconds
- `MASSIVE_FILE_TIMEOUT`: 1 hour for massive file parts

### Part Sizes
- `ZIP_PART_SIZE`: Reduced from 1.9GB to 1.8GB for stability
- `MASSIVE_FILE_PART_SIZE`: 1.5GB for files >10GB

## Usage Examples

### For Large Single Files
```python
from utils.upload_manager import handle_large_file_upload

success, message = await handle_large_file_upload(
    client, chat_id, "/path/to/29gb_file.zip", task, task_manager
)
```

### For ZIP Parts
```python
from utils.upload_manager import handle_zip_parts_upload

part_paths = [("/path/part1.zip", size1), ("/path/part2.zip", size2)]
success = await handle_zip_parts_upload(
    client, chat_id, part_paths, task, task_manager
)
```

### With Automatic Fallback
```python
from utils.upload_manager import upload_with_fallback

success, message = await upload_with_fallback(
    client, chat_id, file_or_parts, task, task_manager
)
```

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed

- Upload progress tracking
- Error context preservation
- Performance metrics

### Progress Messages
- Real-time memory status
- Upload time estimates
- Enhanced error reporting
- Stability indicators

## Best Practices for Large Files

1. **Files 5-10GB**: Use standard improved upload handler
2. **Files 10-50GB**: Automatic massive file handling
3. **Files >50GB**: Enhanced stability mode with warnings
4. **Memory Critical**: Automatic cleanup and monitoring

## Error Recovery

### Automatic Recovery Features
- Memory cleanup on errors
- Progressive retry delays
- Method fallback
- Partial upload tracking

### Manual Recovery
- Failed parts are tracked and reported
- Cleanup on partial failures
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Testing Recommendations

### Large File Tests
1. Test with 29GB+ files to verify no crashes
2. Monitor memory usage during uploads
3. Test connection interruption recovery
4. Verify timeout handling for slow connections

### Stress Tests
1. Multiple large file uploads simultaneously
2. Memory pressure scenarios
3. Network instability simulation
4. Long-duration upload tests

This comprehensive improvement should resolve the crashing issues with large file uploads while maintaining compatibility with existing functionality.
